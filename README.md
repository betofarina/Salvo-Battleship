# Salvo-Battleship
Your job will be to create a front-end web application that game players interact with, and a back-end game server to manage the games, scoring, and player profiles. You will use the jQuery JavaScript library for the front-end client, and the Spring Boot framework for the Java-based RESTful web server.  In Part One of the course, you will implement the core architecture:  A small Java back-end server to store Salvo game data, and send that data to client apps via a RESTful API. A front-end browser-based game interface that graphically shows players the state of the game, including ships they've placed, damage sustained, and scores. In Part Two of the course, you will implement game play:  Players can create new games and join games that others have created. When a game has both players, players can place their ships on their grids. When ships have been placed, players can begin trading salvos (shots) and seeing the results (hits, sinks, and misses). When all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game ends and the winner is added to the leaderboard.
